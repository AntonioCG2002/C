# Final Project: Calculation of Solar Panels

>In this project you will know how many panels you need to have in your house, answering some questions as what is the kWh average used in your house in the last year, how many % do you want to decrease the light bill, and others.

## What is the importance of this project?
We need to know the importance of use the solar energy in Mexico, the cost of installing and generating your own energy here, has declined significantly, we have reached a point where it is cheaper to generate electricity by photovoltaic technology means rather than to buy it from CFE. In Mexico and around the world the price of electricity has skyrocketed and will continue to rise in parallel with oil prices. With a solar panel system you will “freeze” the price of the electricity you consume over the lifetime of the PV solar system (40 years average).

## Benefits of the project
Get a faster proposal for the equipment that is required to be installed in a project in a effectively and efficiently mode.

## How it works the code?
With this code you can do the on-grid calculus and know some information about use solar energy, solar panels, and what is on-grid connection based on solar energy.
