/*
Hello classmate or teacher it's a pleasure to present my project to us. 
I'm going to tell you how to compile:
1.- You need to open https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
2.- Then put the Language into C
3.- Copy each file with the same name 
   a) main.c
   b) funcion.c
   c) funcion.h
4.- Run the program and enjoy the project
5.- When you finish the calculus and exit in the menu,
they are gonna create and .txt file for us
*/
